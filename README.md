# sparqlQueryTester
Goal: Create a Java program that analyses single SPARQL queries for
basic features.

Task details:
* Accept a single SPARQL query string as an input.
* Use a Java library such as OpenRDF or Jena to parse the query.
* Output the following results:
   (1) Is the query correct?
   (2) How many variables does the query contain?
   (3) Return the query string with all comments removed.

Hints:
* You can find many example SPARQL queries at
https://query.wikidata.org/ (see examples)
* The tool does not need a fancy user interface. Inputs can be hardcoded.
* This is not an examination. You can use all resources that you can
find. In particular, feel free to ask me if you have any questions.
* If there are unexpected technical difficulties and the task is not
solvable in the short time, then please let us know. We have not tried
it ourselves yet. The goal here is not to produce a finished product but
to get a work sample from you.
